# Bounce Simulator

Bounce simulator is a software developed in C++, using the OpenGl library to simulate the bounces of a ball against walls. This is a four members team project realised in October 2014 for a school project. It uses mathematics to compute angle of rebounds and translate or rotate the ball thanks to matrix. The trajectories of the ball are computed by an algorithm using the physic equation to get the range of a projectile.
